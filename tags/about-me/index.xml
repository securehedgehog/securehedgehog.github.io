      <description>Hi! My name is Shaz and I&amp;rsquo;ll be using this blog for pretty much anything that I feel that is worth sharing. My aim is to share anything that I learn with others, so that you may benefit from it as well. ðŸ˜„
I have a pet turtle called Tello and I&amp;rsquo;m often found playing my Nintendo Switch - if you have a game you think I should know about, message me.</description>
